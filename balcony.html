        <p>Balcony is a bi-annual collection of conversations with artists situated in the everyday.</p>
        <article>Each issue will contain a selection of dialogues as well as visual stories and original artworks. Sidestepping conventions of both art criticism and the artist profile, balcony presents the artist’s voice as its primary source, blurring the boundaries between the art world and the everyday.

            ISSUE 2 FEATURES
